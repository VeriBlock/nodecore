# Overview

NodeCore SPV (Simple Payment Verification) is a light wallet that allows a user to see their balance and send VBK without downloading, syncing, and running a full node.

Tested on OpenJDK 8, 11, 14, for Windows and Ubuntu Linux

# How to Run SPV

1. Unzip the package to its own folder
2. Run `veriblock-spv.bat` (Windows) or `veriblock-spv` (Linux/Mac)
3. Wait for the SPV to sync (generally 10 minutes for every 1 million blocks; time will vary)

This means SPV is ready:
```

# File Structure

Running the SPV will create a "data" folder, as well as log and wallet files.

# Known Issues

This is a BETA, and there are several known issues.

* SPV does not show locked coins (from MainNet launch). If you have a locked-coin balance, SPV will still show as zero.
* Running importwallet may take a few minutes to sync the new wallet.
