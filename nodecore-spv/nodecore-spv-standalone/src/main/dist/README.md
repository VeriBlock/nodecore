# VeriBlock SPV

## Overview
Proof-of-Proof (PoP) is an abstract consensus algorithm that enables a blockchain to inherit another's Proof-of-Work (PoW) security. VeriBlock is a concrete implementation of a blockchain secured by PoP, and which is purpose-built to provide low-cost and low-friction adoption of PoP for any other blockchain (secured to Bitcoin) without incurring significant technical debt/limitations.
